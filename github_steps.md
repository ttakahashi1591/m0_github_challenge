# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.
- Navigate to the directory for the file you plan to Git in the Terminal.
- Initialize Git using the command `git init`.
- Add the file using the command `git add <filename>`.
- Commit the changes by using the command `git commit -m "Message here"`.
- Create a new GitHub repositiory in your browser. 
- Copy and paste the code under the `...or push an existing repository from the command line` into the Terminal. 
- In the Terminal, use the command `code .` to open VS Code and make changes to the file. 
- Repeat the Git Workflow:
    - Add 
    - Commit
- Use the command `git push` to save changes in GitHub and refresh your browser to see the updated commitment.
